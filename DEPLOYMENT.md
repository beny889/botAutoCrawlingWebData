## Pre-Deployment Checklist ‚úÖ

### 1. Required Environment Variables
Before deploying, ensure you have these values ready to enter in Render.com dashboard:

```bash
# Backend Authentication
BACKEND_USERNAME=superadmin@gmail.com
BACKEND_PASSWORD=Z123465!@

# Telegram Notifications
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=7617892433:AAHrMesr-6MosGqMq5z0JVxFKa61ZAr_abM
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=-4924885979

# Google Sheets API (from service-account-key.json)
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"..."}
```

### 2. Required Files
- ‚úÖ `render.yaml` - Deployment configuration
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` - Prevents committing sensitive files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `service-account-key.json` - Convert to environment variable

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Google Service Account
1. **Convert JSON to Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   # Copy entire content of service-account-key.json
   cat service-account-key.json
   ```
2. **Copy the JSON content** - you'll paste this into Render.com environment variables

### Step 2: Create Render.com Account
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub account
3. Connect your GitHub repository containing this project

### Step 3: Create New Cron Job Service
1. Click **"New +"** ‚Üí **"Cron Job"**
2. **Connect Repository**: Select your GitHub repository
3. **Service Configuration**:
   - **Name**: `automation-bot-2x-daily`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Plan**: `Starter ($7/month)`
   - **Branch**: `main`

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
In Render.com dashboard, add these environment variables:

| Key | Value | Notes |
|-----|-------|--------|
| `BACKEND_USERNAME` | `superadmin@gmail.com` | Backend login |
| `BACKEND_PASSWORD` | `Z123465!@` | Backend password |
| `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` | `7617892433:AAHrMesr-6MosGqMq5z0JVxFKa61ZAr_abM` | Telegram bot token |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | `-4924885979` | Telegram chat ID |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | `{"type":"service_account"...}` | Full JSON content |
| `TZ` | `Asia/Jakarta` | Timezone (UTC+7) |
| `HEADLESS` | `true` | Force headless mode |
| `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` | `1` | Python logging |

### Step 5: Deploy and Monitor
1. **Deploy Service**: Click "Create Cron Job"
2. **Monitor Build**: First build takes 5-10 minutes (Playwright installation)
3. **Check Logs**: Verify successful deployment in Render.com logs
4. **Test Notifications**: Wait for first scheduled run or trigger manually

---

## Scheduled Execution

### Automatic Schedule
- **Morning**: 08:00 WIB (01:00 UTC) - Export yesterday's completed data
- **Evening**: 18:00 WIB (11:00 UTC) - Export today's real-time data
- **Cron Expression**: `"0 1,11 * * *"`

### Manual Execution (Testing)
1. Go to Render.com dashboard
2. Select your cron job service
3. Click **"Trigger Deploy"** to test immediately

---

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Success Indicators
‚úÖ **Build Success**: All dependencies installed without errors  
‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: No missing variable errors in logs  
‚úÖ **Telegram Notifications**: Receive test message on deployment  
‚úÖ **Export Execution**: 1.28 minute execution time  
‚úÖ **Google Sheets**: Data successfully uploaded  

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Build Failures
- **Issue**: Playwright installation timeout
- **Solution**: Use `playwright install chromium --with-deps` (already configured)

#### Authentication Errors
- **Issue**: Missing environment variables
- **Solution**: Verify all environment variables are set in Render dashboard

#### Telegram Not Working
- **Issue**: No notifications received
- **Solution**: Verify `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are correct

#### Google Sheets Permission Denied
- **Issue**: Service account access denied
- **Solution**: Check Google Sheets sharing with service account email

#### Timezone Issues
- **Issue**: Wrong execution time
- **Solution**: Verify `TZ=Asia/Jakarta` in environment variables

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Success patterns to look for:
Environment variables validated successfully
Starting all exports in SINGLE SESSION sequential mode...
Single session automation completed successfully!
Telegram notification sent successfully

# Error patterns to watch for:
Missing required environment variables
Authentication failed
Export failed with exception
Failed to send Telegram message
```
